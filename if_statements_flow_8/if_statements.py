# Control Flow: python program flows from one line to the next and we can change or control by; if-statements, while-loops, and for-loops.

# if statements - decision making

# example 1
code A
if condition:
    code B
code C

# example 2
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

# if statements - And / Or 
# Basically a boolean expression is some form or comparison that yields either a True or a False

# example 3
height = int(input('Height in inches: '))
if height >= 40:
    if height <= 70: 
        print('You may ride')
if height < 40:
    print('You may not ride')
if height > 70:
    print('You may not ride')

# introducing else in if statements
# example 2

# Elif - more than two possible outcomes
# # example 2

# if/elif/else statements - make decisions in python
